        <h1>RedBull Rampage</h1>
        <p>On <mark>Friday, October 21</mark>, the premier big-mountain freeride event showcased the <strong> worldâ€™s top riders </strong>
             as they took on some of the biggest and baddest tricks, lines and bringing the most 
            <i><strong> 'send-ergy' </strong></i>that freeride has ever seen.</p>
        <p>The inaugural Red Bull Rampage was held in <mark> 2001</mark>, and last year we celebrated <strong><mark> 20 years
            of Rampage.</mark></strong> Since then, 15 different events and nine different winners have earmarked
              their place in history books. This year spotlighted the future of <mark> freeriding </mark>- from
               the new crop of athletes grabbing the baton and continuing to innovate the sport, to
                the changemakers that drive the scene, to the mind-blowing action itself.</p>
